AWS DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service provided by AWS. It allows you to store and retrieve large amounts of data with high performance and scalability. Unlike traditional relational databases, DynamoDB uses a key-value and document-oriented model, meaning it doesn't rely on a fixed schema like tables in relational databases. Instead, you work with items and attributes.

How to Use DynamoDB
Creating a Table: The basic unit of data in DynamoDB is a table. When you create a table, you specify:

Primary Key: This is how DynamoDB uniquely identifies each item in the table. It can be a simple key (partition key) or a composite key (partition key + sort key).
Throughput: You can set how much data can be read or written (capacity units), or you can use "on-demand" mode to scale as needed.
Adding Data (Items): Each row of data is called an item, and it is a collection of attributes. Attributes are key-value pairs that can be text, numbers, or binary data.

Reading and Writing Data:

PutItem: Used to add or update an item in the table.
GetItem: Retrieves a single item based on the primary key.
Query: Retrieves multiple items using a partition key and optional sort key.
Scan: Retrieves all items in the table but can be less efficient than Query.
Indexes: You can create secondary indexes (Global Secondary Indexes or Local Secondary Indexes) to improve querying on attributes other than the primary key.

Monitoring and Scaling: You can monitor performance using CloudWatch and adjust the table’s throughput or use auto-scaling for automatic adjustments.



Create a New DynamoDB Table
============================
On the DynamoDB dashboard, click Create table.
Table Name: Enter a name for your table (e.g., UsersTable).
Partition Key: Enter a key (e.g., UserID of type String). This is the primary key DynamoDB will use to find items.
Sort Key (Optional): If you want to uniquely identify an item with two attributes (e.g., UserID and Email), you can add a sort key. For simplicity, skip this for now.
Table Settings: Choose default settings for now to keep it simple.
Read/Write Capacity Mode: Select On-demand to automatically scale.
Click Create Table.



 Add Items (Data) to the Table
=================================
Once your table is created, you’ll be taken to a page that shows your table details.

Click on the Items tab.
Click Create item.
You’ll see a form to add data:
Under UserID (or whatever you named your partition key), enter a unique value (e.g., User123).
Add additional attributes by clicking Add new attribute. For example, you can add attributes like Name (String), Email (String), Age (Number).
After adding the desired attributes, click Create Item.
Repeat this process to add more items to your table.


 Querying Data from the Table
==============================
Go to the Items tab in your table.
Click Actions and select Query.
In the query form, specify the Partition Key (e.g., UserID) and provide a value (e.g., User123).
Click Run to fetch the item.

Scanning the Entire Tabl
========================
Go to the Items tab.
Click Scan.
This will return all items in the table. You can also add conditions to narrow down the results if you have more items.

===============================
In DynamoDB, Capacity Units are a measure of the read and write throughput for your table. They represent how much data can be read from or written to your table per second.
