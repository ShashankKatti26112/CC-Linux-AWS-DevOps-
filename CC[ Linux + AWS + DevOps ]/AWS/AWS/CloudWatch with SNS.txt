Monitoring with CloudWatch
=============================
Why?
CloudWatch monitors your AWS resources and applications in real-time. It can trigger alarms and scale your application automatically based on metrics like CPU utilization, network traffic, etc.or any other actions that you want to take

How?
Go to CloudWatch Dashboard > Create Alarm.
Select Metric:
Choose EC2 > Per-Instance Metrics > CPU Utilization.
Set thresholds: For example, CPU > 70% triggers an alarm.
Action: Attach the alarm to your Auto Scaling group to add or remove instances automatically.

sudo yum install stress -y

stress --cpu 80 --timeout 600

Step 5: Setting Up SNS for Notifications
Why?
Simple Notification Service (SNS) sends automated messages (emails, SMS, etc.) when CloudWatch alarms are triggered, keeping you informed about your applicationâ€™s status.

How?
Go to SNS Dashboard > Create Topic:
Name it AutoScalingAlerts.
Subscribe:
Add your email address to receive notifications.

Attach SNS to CloudWatch Alarm:
Configure the CloudWatch alarm to send notifications to your SNS topic when the alarm is triggered.
