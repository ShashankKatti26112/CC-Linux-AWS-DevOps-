Before Linux â€“ The UNIX Era
In the 1960s, computer scientists at Bell Labs (including Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie) created an operating system called UNIX.
UNIX was multi-user and multitasking, meaning multiple people could use the same computer at once, and it could run several programs simultaneously.
UNIX was not free â€“ companies had to pay for it.


2. The Problem
By the 1980s, UNIX had become very popular, but different companies were making their own versions, which caused compatibility issues.
Also, since UNIX was proprietary (paid software), not everyone could afford to use it.

3. The Birth of Free Software
In the 1980s, Richard Stallman started the Free Software Movement.
He launched the GNU Project to create a free UNIX-like operating system.
GNU provided many tools (like compilers, editors, and shells), but it was missing a critical piece â€“ the kernel (the core of the operating system).

4. The Arrival of Linux (1991)
In 1991, a Finnish student named Linus Torvalds wanted to create a free alternative to MINIX (a small UNIX-like system used for teaching).
Linus wrote a new kernel from scratch and called it Linux.
He shared it online with the open-source community, and developers around the world started contributing.

5. Linux + GNU = Full Operating System
Developers combined Linus' Linux kernel with GNU tools, creating a complete operating system.
This is why sometimes Linux is referred to as GNU/Linux.

6. Linux Today
Linux powers:

Servers (most of the internet runs on Linux)
Supercomputers
Android phones (Android is based on the Linux kernel)
IoT devices
Personal computers (through distributions like Ubuntu and Fedora)

Linux is known for being:

Free and open source
Customizable
Stable and secure
Why is Linux Important?
Cost-effective: No need to pay for licenses.
Reliable: Runs for long periods without crashing.
Flexible: Used in many industries (banking, healthcare, tech).

1. What is Booting?
Booting is the process of starting your computer and loading the operating system (like Red Hat or Windows) so you can use it.

Think of it like waking up a sleeping person â€“ the computer goes from being off to fully awake and ready to work.

Step 1: Press the Power Button
This sends electricity to the computerâ€™s parts (like the CPU, RAM, and motherboard).
The computer wakes up and starts checking if everything is working.

Step 2: POST (Power-On Self Test)
The computer quickly checks if the hardware (keyboard, mouse, RAM, CPU) is okay.
If something is wrong (like RAM is missing), the computer beeps or shows an error.
If everything is fine, the boot continues.
ðŸ‘‰ Analogy: Imagine checking if your shoes and clothes are ready before heading out.

Step 3: BIOS/UEFI (Basic Input/Output System)
BIOS (or UEFI for newer computers) is a small program stored on a chip inside the computer.
It controls basic functions and knows how to talk to hardware.
BIOS looks for a bootable device â€“ like a hard disk, USB, or CD.
ðŸ‘‰ Analogy: BIOS is like the brain's reflexes â€“ it knows how to control basic body parts.

Step 4: MBR (Master Boot Record)
The BIOS hands over control to the first part of the hard drive called the MBR.
The MBR contains a tiny program that finds and loads the bootloader.
ðŸ‘‰ Analogy: Think of MBR as a door to a building â€“ it opens the way to the main entrance (bootloader).

Step 5: GRUB (Grand Unified Bootloader)
GRUB is a special program that loads the operating system (Linux).
It shows a menu asking you to choose which operating system to load (if you have more than one).
After you choose, it loads the Linux kernel.
ðŸ‘‰ Analogy: GRUB is like a restaurant menu â€“ you choose what you want to eat (or which OS to load).

Step 6: Linux Kernel Loads
The Linux kernel is the heart of the operating system.
It gets loaded into the computerâ€™s memory (RAM) and starts controlling the hardware.
The kernel then starts the init system (like SYSTEMD), which turns on services (like networking, user logins, etc.).
ðŸ‘‰ Analogy: The kernel is like a manager who controls the staff (hardware and services).

Step 7: Login Screen Appears
After loading all services, the computer shows the login screen.
Now you can enter your username and password to start using the computer.
ðŸ‘‰ Analogy: This is like reaching the front door of your house, unlocking it, and stepping inside.

What are the flavours in Linux

ubuntu
redhat
centos
Debian
fedora 
===============================================================================
Linux : Linux is an open source os, which directly manages a system's hardware and resources like CPU, storage and memory.

The Linux kernel: 
is the core component of the Linux operating system (OS) that acts as an interface between the computer's hardware and its processes. It's the first thing to load when a computer boots up and remains in the computer's memory throughout a session.

A shell is a program that allows users to interact with a Linux operating system (OS) by typing commands

Flavours of linux :
1. ubuntu
2. Debian
3. Fedora (RHEL)
4. Linux mint

why Linux:
1-->open source
2-->highly secure
3-->Easy to use
4-->cheaper compare windows systems
==================================================================================================

clear: used to clear the screen

touch <filename> : It is used create empty file.
ls : It is used to list the files and directories.
ls -l/ll : It is used to list the files and directories in long format.
ls -lt : It is used to list the files and directories in long format with recently modified file on the top.
ls -lrt : It is used to list the files and directories in long format with recently modified file on the bottom.
ls -a : It is used to list hidden files with other files and directories
ls -al/ll : It is used to list hidden files in long format.

mkdir <dirname> : It is used to create directory(folder).
mkdir -p dir1/dir2/dir3/   to create nested directories.
tree--> directory structure can be viewed.
cd <dirname> : cd(change directory) is used to get into the directory.
cd ../ : It is used to come out of the directory one level.
pwd (Present working directory) : It is used to check the location.
history: it prints all the previous commands you used
