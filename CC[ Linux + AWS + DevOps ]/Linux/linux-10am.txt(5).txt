Before Linux â€“ The UNIX Era
In the 1960s, computer scientists at Bell Labs (including Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie) created an operating system called UNIX.
UNIX was multi-user and multitasking, meaning multiple people could use the same computer at once, and it could run several programs simultaneously.
UNIX was not free â€“ companies had to pay for it.


2. The Problem
By the 1980s, UNIX had become very popular, but different companies were making their own versions, which caused compatibility issues.
Also, since UNIX was proprietary (paid software), not everyone could afford to use it.

3. The Birth of Free Software
In the 1980s, Richard Stallman started the Free Software Movement.
He launched the GNU Project to create a free UNIX-like operating system.
GNU provided many tools (like compilers, editors, and shells), but it was missing a critical piece â€“ the kernel (the core of the operating system).

4. The Arrival of Linux (1991)
In 1991, a Finnish student named Linus Torvalds wanted to create a free alternative to MINIX (a small UNIX-like system used for teaching).
Linus wrote a new kernel from scratch and called it Linux.
He shared it online with the open-source community, and developers around the world started contributing.

5. Linux + GNU = Full Operating System
Developers combined Linus' Linux kernel with GNU tools, creating a complete operating system.
This is why sometimes Linux is referred to as GNU/Linux.

6. Linux Today
Linux powers:

Servers (most of the internet runs on Linux)
Supercomputers
Android phones (Android is based on the Linux kernel)
IoT devices
Personal computers (through distributions like Ubuntu and Fedora)

Linux is known for being:

Free and open source
Customizable
Stable and secure
Why is Linux Important?
Cost-effective: No need to pay for licenses.
Reliable: Runs for long periods without crashing.
Flexible: Used in many industries (banking, healthcare, tech).
=========================================================================================================================
1. What is Booting?
Booting is the process of starting your computer and loading the operating system (like Red Hat or Windows) so you can use it.

Think of it like waking up a sleeping person â€“ the computer goes from being off to fully awake and ready to work.

Step 1: Press the Power Button
This sends electricity to the computerâ€™s parts (like the CPU, RAM, and motherboard).
The computer wakes up and starts checking if everything is working.

Step 2: POST (Power-On Self Test)
The computer quickly checks if the hardware (keyboard, mouse, RAM, CPU) is okay.
If something is wrong (like RAM is missing), the computer beeps or shows an error.
If everything is fine, the boot continues.
ðŸ‘‰ Analogy: Imagine checking if your shoes and clothes are ready before heading out.

Step 3: BIOS/UEFI (Basic Input/Output System)
BIOS (or UEFI for newer computers) is a small program stored on a chip inside the computer.
It controls basic functions and knows how to talk to hardware.
BIOS looks for a bootable device â€“ like a hard disk, USB, or CD.
ðŸ‘‰ Analogy: BIOS is like the brain's reflexes â€“ it knows how to control basic body parts.

Step 4: MBR (Master Boot Record)
The BIOS hands over control to the first part of the hard drive called the MBR.
The MBR contains a tiny program that finds and loads the bootloader.
ðŸ‘‰ Analogy: Think of MBR as a door to a building â€“ it opens the way to the main entrance (bootloader).

Step 5: GRUB (Grand Unified Bootloader)
GRUB is a special program that loads the operating system (Linux).
It shows a menu asking you to choose which operating system to load (if you have more than one).
After you choose, it loads the Linux kernel.
ðŸ‘‰ Analogy: GRUB is like a restaurant menu â€“ you choose what you want to eat (or which OS to load).

Step 6: Linux Kernel Loads
The Linux kernel is the heart of the operating system.
It gets loaded into the computerâ€™s memory (RAM) and starts controlling the hardware.
The kernel then starts the init system (like SYSTEMD), which turns on services (like networking, user logins, etc.).
ðŸ‘‰ Analogy: The kernel is like a manager who controls the staff (hardware and services).

Step 7: Login Screen Appears
After loading all services, the computer shows the login screen.
Now you can enter your username and password to start using the computer.
ðŸ‘‰ Analogy: This is like reaching the front door of your house, unlocking it, and stepping inside.

What are the flavours in Linux

ubuntu
redhat
centos
Debian
fedora 
===============================================================================
Linux : Linux is an open source os, which directly manages a system's hardware and resources like CPU, storage and memory.

The Linux kernel: 
is the core component of the Linux operating system (OS) that acts as an interface between the computer's hardware and its processes. It's the first thing to load when a computer boots up and remains in the computer's memory throughout a session.

A shell is a program that allows users to interact with a Linux operating system (OS) by typing commands

Flavours of linux :
1. ubuntu
2. Debian
3. Fedora (RHEL)
4. Linux mint

why Linux:
1-->open source
2-->highly secure
3-->Easy to use
4-->cheaper compare windows systems

How to change file and directory permissions
=============================================
chmod(change mode) : It is used change permissions for files and directories.

we have 3 kind of categories
r - read - 4
w - write - 2
x - execute - 1

we have 3 kinds groups
users
group
others

For ex : Changing permissions for file
1. If you want to give all permissions for user, group or others/ for a particular file

                users group others
  for file f1 - r+w+x r+w+x r+w+x
                4+2+1 4+2+1 4+2+1
	          7     7     7

syn : chmod 777 <filename>

2. If you want to give only read permission for user, write permission for group, and read and execute permission for others to f3 file
        users group others
  f3 - r w r+x
       4 2 4+1
	4 2 5
		syn : chmod 425 <filename>

For ex: Changing permission for directory
1.  If you want to give all permissions for user, group or others/ particular directory
	   users group others
  f3 - r+w+x r+w+x r+w+x
       4+2+1 4+2+1 4+2+1
	     7     7     7	
		 syn : chmod -R 777 <directory name>
Note : Can you add or remove the permissions for user group or others without using binary format?
       - yes
	   For eg : chmod u+x,g+w,o-r <filename>
	   For eg : chmod u-wx,g+rx,o+rw <filename>
	   For eg : chmod a+rwx <filename>
	   
Note : TO perform this operation we need to have root previledges
To become root we need to use sudo

chown(change ownership) :It is used to change the ownership of a file/dir1
syn : sudo chown <newownername> <filename>
      sudo chown -R <newownername> <directoryname>
	  
chgrp(change groupname): It is used to change groupname for files/dir1
syn : sudo chgrp <newgroupname> <filename>
      sudo chgrp -R <newgroupname> <dirname>
=====================================================
sudo useradd <username> : It is used to create user.
sudo passwd <username>: it will promt to create a password(enter twice same password)
sudo userdel <username> : It is used to delete user.
sudo groupadd <groupname> : It is used to create group.
sudo groupdel <groupname> : It is used to delete group.
sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash username (command to create user with home directory)
sudo usermod -l new_username old_username(to modify the username)
sudo chsh -s /bin/bash <username>
adduser-->create user ,home dir at once 
sudo usermod -aG groupname username--> to add user into the group
sudo cat /etc/group  --> to view list of users in a group
cut -d: -f1 /etc/passwd---> to check the list of users
cut -d: -f1 /etc/group--> to see list of groups

to switch as created user
su <username>
exit    to come out of user
============================================================================
============================================================================
getfacl is used to display the current ACLs set on files or directories.
syntax : getfacl file.txt

setfacl -m u:username:rwx file.txt
setfacl -m g:groupname:r-x file.txt
setfacl -m d:u:username:rwx dir/

===================================

Passwordless connection between 2 servers
=====================================================
Step 1 - create 2 servers 
   run following commands after ssh into them
   sudo hostnamectl set-hostname server1-----on server 1
   sudo hostnamectl set-hostname server2-----on server2
   go to server1 
   cd .ssh/ 
step 2 - Run "ssh-keygen -t rsa" on server1
         type enter for all the options(3 times)
         check for the creation of id_rsa and id_rsa.pub files
         cat id_rsa.pub

step 3 - copy generated pub key from server 1 and paste it into server2's authorized_keys file 
         goto server2 
         cd .ssh/
         echo "copied public key from server1" >> authorized_keys
         
step 4 - change permission for authorized_keys file in server2 to 700
step 5 - Run ssh username@server2_publicip to make passwordless connection between 2 servers.

            ssh ec2-user@65.0.32.193



Edit if required

sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
change passwordauthentication to yes 
sudo systemctl restart sshd
